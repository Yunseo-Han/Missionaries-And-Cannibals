# Missionaries-and-Cannibals
The missionaries and cannibals problem is a well-known toy problem in artificial intelligence.

Missionaries and Cannibals is a problem in which 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals want to
cross from the left bank of a river to the right bank of the river. There is a boat on the left
bank, but it only carries at most two people at a time (and can never cross with zero
people). If cannibals ever outnumber missionaries on either bank, the cannibals will eat
the missionaries.
